### (P1) "Why I'm on friendworld"
  - "Hey guys, first time poster here. I just completed my profile a few minutes ago, and am really excited to interact with the community here :)  I can't even begin to tell you about how sick and tired I was of all those other social media platforms, with the shallow culture they perpetuated, and all their targetted advertisements. They don't care about my wellbeing -- they just want to use their sophisticated algorithms to monitor my posts, show my hyper targetted ads, and track me through my phone. They do some crazy stuff! Did you know that a lot of these websites have trackers on websites all around the itnernet? So if you read a news article on cat food, they know! Then that's all you'll see: cat food ads. And to make matters worse, they'll track your location on your phone to see how well those ads work. God help you if you click the ad and buy that brand of cat food... or even let your geolocation within 10 yards of a pet store. All they care about is making a quick buck! But friendworld seems genuinly different. They seem to really care about user experience and forging deep connections between us. "
  b: "I hear you, man. It's truly shameful how much time I waste on the internet. And I don't say that in a hyperbolic time-poorly-spent way. I *waste* a lot of time. I got home from work today, beat as usual, and told myself I would only spend a few minutes clicking around to unwind. And almost as if I was hypnotized, I finally come to my senses 4 hours later. What did I do during that time? Nothing. I clicked back and forth between facebook and reddit and twitter. I don't remember anything I saw. It was like I entered a trance. That can't be healthy, can it? I might as well have been asleep that entire time. No brain activity whatsoever. My attention span is so shot that I cand barely write this post. "

### (P3) "I give up"
    a: "I'm giving up dating. I can't do it any more. I'm 27 years old, and I've never had a girlfriend. I must have been on close to 200 first dates at this point, and it's been a constant stream of failure, rejection, and shame. I don't know why it hasn't worked out for me. I have a job, and hobbies, and social skills. I'm not the most good looking guy in the world, but in far from hideous. I respect women. But nothing seems to be working. The constant treadmill of dating is making me nauseous. I can't bring myself to go on certain dates because they remind me of other failures. I used to get excited whenever I came across a pretty girl. Now I just get depressed because I know she's out of my league and will never want to date me. I feel like the only respectable thing to do at this point is to give up. "
    """
      I'm 32 now, and I haven't had any sort of meaningful emotional connection in my love life in years. And I really try. But whenever I find someone I think I like (after maybe 6 months of looking), it never seems to go anywhere. We just get the point in a couple weeks where I can see an emotional connection being forged... but I'm just not part of it. She's falling for a facade of me. And I'd really like to participate. I'm not just a caricature of the millennial dating man who's only looking for sex. I want that emotional connection.
      I can't say that I have a "type" -- I go after all sorts of women, but I can't help but think that maybe a type is attracted to me. Maybe it's the delusional type who falls for my poor excuse of showing affection.

### (P4) "How many years do we have left"
  - "How many years do we have left? I wake up every day, and I see the deterioration of the environment. Increasing malicious political polarization. Unbelievable amounts of greed. This isn't sustainable. Humans have far exceeded the carrying capacity if the earth. What do we have? 10 years? 20 if we're being optimistic?"

### (P5) "Anyone had any good dreams recently?"
  - "I dreamt that my father had an underground goat farm, where he was breeding a pack of goats with no limbs inside 20 foot pits. When I found it, he handed me some grilled goat meat with the skin/fur still on one side. It was pretty good. If you ever get the chance to eat goat meat, I reccomend it"
  - "Last week I had a weird one. Men in suites came to my house, broke the door down, and tore up my living room. They were looking for my secret documents. But they couldn't find them. I knew they'd come, so I took the propper precautions. When I woke up, the place was trashed. "
