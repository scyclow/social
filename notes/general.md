I guess this is my attempt at non-linear, interactive fiction, where you read the posts of fake accounts, chat with chat bots, and try to accumulate likes/karma/whatever. And while it claims to help connect people, it just isolates you from other humans because it takes place entirely in the web browser and you're just talking with robots. Meanwhile, it uses dishonest web design patterns to try and get you addicted to checking for notifications, and pushes targeted ads for other fake websites I've done.
