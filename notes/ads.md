## (AD11) Seven Steps to Dating Success
  - #7S2DS
  - The Game/RP-style PUA advice
  - "dating hacks" -- frame as manipulation, even though a lot of it is common sense that works equally for both genders
    - "women have inferior intelligence, and will fall for these tricks every day of the week. remember, YOU're in control"
  - odd paranoia about getting accused of rape
    - "in today's day and age, with internet dating and feminazis running rampant, "
  - "men being accused of rape is at an all time high"
  - the seven steps (men):
    1. find meaning in your life outside of women/getting laid - women love status, having hobbies feeds their fantasies about the life they're stepping into. having friends == status & character references if you get accused of rape
    2. be attractive - be clean/dress well/work out -
    3. be charming - make eye contact, get them to talk more than you, make physical contact, give/look for IOIs. "if you make kino and they aren't into it, SLAM ON THE BREAKS. ". also, don't be a creep - dont act desperate, you might get accused of rape
    4. make sure they enjoy the sex - if they don't like it, they might accuse you of raping them
    5. provide continued emotional support - if they don't feel "betrayed" or "manipulated", hey won't accuse you of raping them. "after you've done the deed, text them to make sure they got home okay. This serves the double function of giving you a receipt, PROVING you didn't rape them. women are delicate emotional creatures, and the risk of retaliation is high."
    6. if they're not into you, then MOVE ON. that bitch isn't worth your time. don't get oneitis. there are plenty of other girls you can get with, so getting hung up on one isn't worth it.
    7. don't rape them -- "this is the number one thing that guys do to get accused of rape. as a precaution, you should try to avoid this at all costs. this can be hard, as women are naturally submissive and desire sexual domination. And even if they have a rape fantasy (many do!), the risk to you is too high. another good idea in some of the 'rougher' sexual contexts is to have a 'safe word'. as silly as this sounds, it's a good warning sign that you need to slam on the breaks fast -- else she might think that she's being raped. you might also be inclined to record all your sexual encounters to prove that it was consensual, but this is best avoided as well. this is incredibly hard to pull off covertly, and the risk of getting found out is too high -- espescially if you show it to other people. finally, don't try to be a smart guy by slipping something into their dirnk. women are creatures controlled by their bodies, so they'll KNOW something's up the next day. don't try to be a smart guy about all this."
