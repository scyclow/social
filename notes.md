I guess this is my attempt at non-linear, interactive fiction, where you read the posts of fake accounts, chat with chat bots, and try to accumulate likes/karma/whatever. And while it claims to help connect people, it just isolates you from other humans because it takes place entirely in the web browser and you're just talking with robots. Meanwhile, it uses dishonest web design patterns to try and get you addicted to checking for notifications, and pushes targetted ads for other fake websites I've done.



as you start off, you're presented with a slew of marketing material. at first glance, it seems that the point of the website is a social network that connects people.

right off the bat, it appears that gaining points/karma/likes rewards you. (need some extrinsic motivation here, besides the addicting properties)

quickly, it appears that some of the accounts are robots, and others are humans (they're all robots; but it would be interesting if players are hooked up randomly to other actual human players. or, the easy version of this is to hook them up to firebase where i can talk to them)

it also appears that there are several overlapping factions of people, corresponding to different ads:
  - conservative news junkies (news)
  - crypto get-rich-quick folks (finance)
  - cult devotees (spirituality)
  - fuckbois (dating)
  - train enthusiasts
  - "I'm just trying to sell shit" (market place)
  - bot hunters
  - wrestlers building up a match
  - end herpes

there are also many individual characters:
  - dream journal
  - video game fan website
  - hot sauce
  - someone who builds a quick raport with you, but dissapointingly turns out to be a bot

and depending on the info you give up, you see targetted ads:
  - fastcashmoneyplus.biz
  - fakebullshit.news articls
  - identityrecoverymanagementsystem
  - cult website (leading to whereisyourgodnow.xyz)
  - penis pills/weight loss
  - camwhore
  - hotsauce
  - generic repeating video mashup of tinnitus/skin sagging/etc
  - t shirts that you can actually buy
  - 0ms.co
    - web development and hosting services circa 1997 (j geoff, heaven's gate)


names:
  socialworld
  friendworld.social
  friendzone

overarching theme:
  the mysterious creator is just trying to sell you various shit
  there are some saps floating around the website
  story here is that fastcash is buying a lot of advertising - espescially on fake bullshit.
    this means that fakebullshit is trying to get clicks to make fastcash ad revenue
    fastcash is really the base of the ad ecosystem

bot behavior/culture
  - call each other by shortened versions of their screen names
  - they clearly lie/exagerate about their personal lives; stories are inconsistent from thread to thread: "I have a great life because a, b, c"; "I have a great live because A B D"
  - some profiles are private; and you can't see their messages - it creates a hole in the dialog until you're friends with them
  - default: bot's are scheduled to check posts at certain time, and just give an automatic response to whatever was posted last. They check certain groups at certain times. mods maybe check every 5 minutes, so you always get a fresh response.
  - some instances where bots clearly have multiple accounts to support their arguments. all some accounts do is agree with other single accounts
  -"are you jewish?"
    "yes"
      accusation about controlling the media, or try to sell some religious shit

quests:
  - main quest involves piecing together a technicratic conspiracy theory where jews control the media + the financial system. fastcashmoneyplus.biz and fakebullshit.news way to achieve freedom. dating websites are designed to manipulate your sexual desires. there's some Q-like ringleader, anonymously dipersing information

  - videos, sales text, etc mention specific people

    - ads are mostly for identitymanagementrecoverysystems
    - you want to get invited to next some other group
    - as part of the progress, someone asks you to find out all you can about some joe schmo
    - similarity in the ad language and request ("dig up some dirt on this guy"; "find out who this person *really* is") makes it clear that you're supposed to use id-mgmt-rec-sys
    - maybe id-mgmt-rec-sys spits out the friendworld screen name of joe schmo
    - you have to contact joe schmo
  - you end up in finance
    - people want you to click their fcmp link
    - you get something if you post the special text from the fastcash wallet

gameplay
  - you start off with access to general
  - there's some other group you want to get access to, but it's invite only
  - you need to talk to people to get invited to other groups
  - if people don't like you, they won't give you any information
  - you need to figure out what they want to talk about, and give them the right answers
    - ex: start off with access to general; message someone; ask if they know the admin to politics; they don't but some other guy might; you ask that other guy, and need to get on his good side; he tells you to talk to someone else "and let me know what he says"; you talk to the other guy, but they don't like you. you go back a step, and they tell you someone else
  - sometimes you need a certain number of likes to get something
  - you get more likes depending on whether you post stuff the group likes, and whether you've talked to people and they like you

  = for most bots it makes sense to only have a limted number of things they can do, even in the groups. a lot of the conversations are clearly the bots talking to each other, but they make unique conversation

  = there needs to be a distribution of how much time i put into the bots
    - 1 bot with incredibly deep dialog possabilities (admin?)
    - 5 or 6 with a reasonably large amount of depth. pretty much one
    - 10 or 20 that are pretty flat, but coherent responses. like side characters in shenmue
    - 30 or 50 that just spit out markvov text

  - every once in a while group members start a mutiny, and create another group

  everyone is given "special referral link"
  "Congratulations! You've been selected to participate in an exciting new social network as a beta user. This is very exclusive opportunity to meet vibrant, intelligent, and friendly people. Engage in collegial and unique discussion. "
  "Be respectful of other users. if they don't respond right away, they will eventually"
  "Be sure to follow the moderation policy. We have very strict enforcememt guidlines"

chat tips/things to make obvious:
  - say hi
  - a/s/l
  - people respond to emoticons
  - talk about things that interest them -- what they're talking about in public forums
  - the more likes you have, the more likely someone responds
  - people have certain hours during which they'll respond to you

to get points, you post stuff
likes are a function of who you're friends with, and what words they pick up on
when you get new connections, they retroactively like your posts
most users will follow you back

people will follow you if you post in public forums
people will follow you if you message them
  some people will be trolls, and won't leave you alone
  some people won't message you
  if you're a woman and post in dating, you'll get a lot of fuckbois messaging you. some will be malicious if you reject them or don't respond.
  if you're a man, no women daters will respond to you. if they do, it will be lackluster sometimes men will message you.

  - single post by old guy: "what's your favorit sports team?"

    - no responses
    - i user responds, then "Ah yes, the <sports team>, they had a great season back in 2012 ;)"
- dating & romance
  - "I'm giving up"
    a: "I'm giving up dating. I can't do it any more. I'm 27 years old, and I've never had a girlfriend. I must have been on close to 200 first dates at this point, and it's been a constant stream of failure, rejection, and shame. I don't know why it hasn't worked out for me. I have a job, and hobbies, and social skills. I'm not the most good looking guy in the world, but in far from hideous. I respect women. But nothing seems to be working. The constant treadmill of dating is making me nauseous. I can't bring myself to go on certain dates because they remind me of other failures. I used to get excited whenever I came across a pretty girl. Now I just get depressed because I know she's out of my league and will never want to date me. I feel like the only respectable thing to do at this point is to give up. "
    b: "y'all need to man up"
    c: "yeah, stop being such a f*cking downer"

- general
  - "stop wasting your time"
    a: "how much time do you think you spend on the internet every day? how much do you spend in a week? a month? a year? now, how much of that time would you say was *meaningful*? i'm talking about time spent in a way that you'll look back in 10 years with no regrets. maybe you learned something from a wikipedia rabit hole. maybe you engaged in a thoughtful discussion. maybe you experienced some memorable art. people find meaning in all sorts of things, and whatever does it for you is fine. now, how much of that time spent would you consider *wasted*? mindlessly clicking around? browsing back and forth between the same four websites..."
    b: "shut up, a"
    c: "yeah, shut up a. stop being such a killjoy"
    d: "i hear that. we're living in an age of spiritual bankruptcy. "

  - "I'm boooord"
    a: "I'm bored. send me a DM. We can talk about the weather, sports, whatever"

  - "help"
    basically, an old peron trying to escape form a retirement home. when you chat them, it leads to a mini text adventure of you telling the, what to do to ge tout

  - "The collapse of civilization is imminent"
